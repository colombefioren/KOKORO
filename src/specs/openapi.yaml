    post:
      summary: Update the current user's bio
      description: |
        Updates the **bio field** of the currently authenticated user.  
        This endpoint is typically called from the profile settings screen when a user edits their personal description.

        The new bio is a simple text string that appears on the user's profile and may be visible to others in rooms, chats, or social spaces — depending on privacy settings.

        Requires a valid BetterAuth session (sent via session cookie) to verify user identity.
